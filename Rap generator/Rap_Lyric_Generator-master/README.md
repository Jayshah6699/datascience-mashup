Overview
============
A project that trains a Hidden Markov Model over a dataset of rap song lyrics. You can generate a rap using a single word as the starting point. This the code for 'Generate Rap Lyrics' on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/yE0dcDNRZjw)

Dependencies
============
* Python 2.7+ (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Basic Usage
===========

Once you've downloaded the repository simply type the following into terminal

`MarkovRap.py some_word_goes_here`

Replace 'some_word_goes_here' with a word of your choosing. The rap will be generated from your word.

Credits
===========
Credit for the vast majority of code here goes to [Ted Xiao](https://github.com/txizzle/Markov_Rap_Generator). I've merely created a wrapper around all of the important functions to get people started.

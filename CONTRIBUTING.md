## ⭐Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Jayshah6699/datascience-mashup/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [team@tesseractcoding.tech](mailto:team@tesseractcoding.tech).

## ⭐How Can I Contribute?

**Those who are already familiar with Git can read below guidelines and start working :**
- Take a look at the Existing [Issues](https://github.com/Jayshah6699/datascience-mashup/issues) or create your own Issues!
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you. Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon. 
- Make your changes.
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.

**Those who are contributing for the first time please follow the steps mentioned below to get familiar with the contribution processes.**

***If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).***

### ⭐Reporting Bugs

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible since it helps in resolving the issues faster.
- **Give sample code** if you can.
- **What you expected** would happen.
- **What actually happened.**
- **Notes** (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### ⭐Suggesting New Enhancements

Submitting an enhancement suggestion , includes completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

##### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion :

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/Jayshah6699/datascience-mashup/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which can help you to describe effectively.

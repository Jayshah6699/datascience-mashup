# colordetection

To detect the color in a given image using python libraries such as OpenCV and pandas.

To train this model I had used color names along with its code in heaxadecimal and in RGB stored in csv file.

Also uploaded different images to try on.

#### Requirements :
`pip install opencv`
`pip install pandas`






A quick demo of this is present below

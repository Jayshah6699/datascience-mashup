It is implemented on Python using Linear Regression Models.Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Used the Quandl API to apply ML to the stock market.

**Linear Regression Pros**:
- Simple to implement.
- Overfitting can be reduced by regularization
- Used to predict numeric values.
- Performance on linearly seperable datasets

**Linear Regression Cons**:
- Prone to overfitting.
- Sensitive to outliers
- Cannot be used when the relation between independent and dependent variable are non linear.
